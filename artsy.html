  <h1>Artsy Lense</h1>
  <div class="lense">
    <p> I love taking photos because i love seeing the inner beauty in things</p>
    <p> I gained interest in the field when I was around 15, I had experienced alot of things in that period of my life and it came to me that if i had recorded those moments id recall them even after 10 years,then the idea of getting a camera came to my
      head and here i am</p>
  </div>
  <p> After having used it for a couple of years i asked myself what else could i do with it so i sat down and started brainstorming and wondered how i wouldve monetized it.</p>
  <p><span class="ideas">So i jolted down a couple of ideas:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a new lense</li>
      <li>Set up a webpage for the business im planning</li>
      <li>Make a social media account so as to create awareness of who i am as well as add the link to my photography webpage in the about me section of my profile.</li>
      <li>look for beautiful models so as to attract customers</li>
      <li> Tell my friends to recommend my services to their other friends</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
