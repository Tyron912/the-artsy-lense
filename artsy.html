    <p> I love taking photos because i love seeing the inner beauty in things</p>
    <p> I gained interest in the field when I was around 15, I had experienced alot of things in that period of my life and it came to me that if i had recorded those moments id recall them even after 10 years,then the idea of getting a camera came to my
      head and here i am</p>

  <div="column">
    <p> After having used it for a couple of years i asked myself what else could i do with it so i sat down and started brainstorming and wondered how i wouldve monetized it.</p>
    <p><span class="ideas">So i jolted down a couple of ideas:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a new lense</li>
      <li>Set up a webpage for the business im planning</li>
      <li>Make a social media account so as to create awareness of who i am as well as add the link to my photography webpage in the about me section of my profile.</li>
      <li>look for beautiful models so as to attract customers</li>
      <li> Tell my friends to recommend my services to their other friends</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar">
      <p> Here is a sample of one of my works:</p>

    <div class="column">
      <p> As my business kept expanding i needed more capital in order to expand it.So i converted my business into a patnership and <span class="ideas">brought in my friends:</span></p>
      <ol>
        <li>bill</li>
        <li>james</li>
        <li>steven</li>
      </ol>
      <p> By adding their captial we were able to invest into a small office apartment and convert it into our base of operations</p>
